# project2
Final project for CS50 

the site/app is alright right now, but I just need like 1-2 things to level up the complexity a little 

I would like to use an api to input a calendar or weather tracker or the like (something releveant to hiking)

I've tried to different configurations of weather tracks/apps/maps but none are working. I think it is operator error with entering/coding/using the API key
